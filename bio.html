	<h1>A Little Bit About Seth Kahn</h1>
	<p>I grew up in a small town in Connecticut with my father, who is a psychiatrist,
		my mother, who is a reading consultant, and my older sister.</p>
	<p>I attended my local public high school, taking required courses and acquiring a particular
		interest in the natural sciences, especially physics. In the summers of 2012 and 2013,
		I developed a curiosity for computer science, and entertained that curiosity with some
		self study of isolated programming topics.</p>
	<p>I now attend Tufts University, considering a degree in the realm of computation. I am 
		considering a double degree in computer engineering and computer science, or possibly
		a degree just in computer science. Still, I take courses in physics to entertain my
		interest in the sciences.</p>
