README.txt

This webpage was designed to display some basic information about me on a personal and professional level. The homepage was designed to display my name and appearance, and link the user to my professional resume and brief personal biography.

The resume I have at the moment is brief, as I am still a freshman without much college experience.The biography I have is also brief, but overviews my education and family life.

All the content was coded in HTML and styled in CSS, with a separate style sheet for each page. No javascript was used, but some CSS responsive design techniques were used to handle the size of the browser window so as not to distort the content.
